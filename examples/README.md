# XRF Example programs
This directory contains examples of XRF programs. Given that XRF programs
cannot have comments, and tend to be quite cryptic, here are some explanations
of the programs in the directory:

* **2.xrf**: Outputs arbitrarily many powers of two. This program was generated
             and could likely be made quite a bit shorter with better generation.
* **aaaaa.xrf**: Outputs AAAAA endlessly.
* **ascii.xrf**: Repeatedly outputs all of the ASCII characters.
* **cat.xrf**: Copies the input of the program to the output.
* **hello.xrf**: Prints "Hello, World!".
* **quine.xrf**: Undoubtedly the most impressive program written in XRF, this massive
                 program, written by [Keymaker](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Keymaker)
                 outputs its own source code.
* **rot13.xrf**: Performs [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) text
                 encoding on the input to the program.
* **truth.xrf**: Implements a [truth machine](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Truth-machine).
                 Reads a byte of input, outputs a 0 if the input was 0, and outputs 1
                 endlessly if the input was 1.
